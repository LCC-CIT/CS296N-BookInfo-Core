# ASP.NET Core MVC Demo App

This ASP.NET Core MVC web app was written to demonstrate specific concepts. Each branch was created while adding new features as examples of a particular set of ASP.NET MVC programming concepts. The branches are described below:

1. **InputForm** demonstrates implementing an input form and saving data to the database via a repository and Entity Framework.

2. **TestingWithFakeRepositories** demonstrates the use of fake repositories to facilitate unit testing of controller methods by means of Dependency Injection (DI).

3. **AddEF** demonstrates using Entity Framework Core as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for a SQL database. The repository pattern continues to be used.

This demo was written for CS 296N, Web Development 2: ASP.NET, at Lane Community College.
