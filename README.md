This ASP.NET Core MVC web app was written to demonstrate programming concepts. Each branch was created while adding new fretures as examples of a particular set of programming concepts. The branches are described below:

- **TestingWithFakeRepositories** demonstrates the use of fake repositories to facilitate unit testing of controller methods by means of Dependency Injection (DI).
- **AddingEFCore** demonstrates using Entity Framework Core as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for a SQL database. The repository pattern continues to be used.
- **Navigation** demonstrates searching and adding a navigation menu to the shared laout.
- **InputForm** demonstrates implementing an input form and saving data to the database via a repository and Entity Framework.
- **Validation** demonstrates validating input both in the browser and on the server using Tag Helpers and Data Annotations.
- **Authentication** demonstrates Registration, login, and authentication of users.
- **ReviewByReader** demonstrates adding a user via the SeedData class, making a user object the member of another domain model. The Identity user and the domain entities are stored in separate databases.

This demo was written for CS296N, Web Development 2:ASP.NET, at Lane Community College.
