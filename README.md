This ASP.NET Core MVC web app was written to demonstrate programming concepts. Each branch was created while adding new fretures as examples of a particular set of programming concepts. The branches are described below:

- **TestingWithFakeRepositories** demonstrates the use of fake repositories to facilitate unit testing of controller methods by means of Dependency Injection (DI).
- **AddingEFCore** demonstrates using Entity Framework Core as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for a SQL database. The repository pattern continues to be used.
- **Navigation** demonstrates searching and adding a navigation menu to the shared laout.

This demo was written for CS296N, Web Development 2:ASP.NET, at Lane Community College.
